# Simple CMD Shell Program

## Getting Started
This program is a simple and basic shell program written in Python, which replicates Windows CMD commands such as creating a directory (dir), changing a directory (cd), displaying messages (echo), and so on. The following document will help you get started on setting up the program.

## Prerequisites
This program requires Python 3.10 to run and was written in 3.12.1. To download, go to python.org and download Python 3.10.x or above. You will not be required to install any additional libraries as we are using default libraries.

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code onto your local machine. Navigate to the directory of the script and run it through the terminal or an IDE.

## Usage
Run the following program on the terminal:

python shell.py

When the program starts, you will be greeted with a menu containing the following options:

Select an action to perform
[dir] 		List Current Directory
[cd]	 	Change Directory
[mkdir]	Create New Directory
[echo] 		Display Message
[type] 		Concatenate and Display File Content
[q] 		Exit

Simply type in the command you want to execute in front of the “> “ prompt and follow the instructions that appear for each command executed.
